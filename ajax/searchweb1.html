  <h3> AJAX - INTRODUCTION </h3>
  <pre> 
    
    *** AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
      *  AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications
         with the help of XML, HTML, CSS and Java Script.
      * Conventional web application transmit information to and from the sever 
         using synchronous requests. This means you fill out a form, hit submit, 
         and get directed to a new page with new information from the server.
      * With AJAX when submit is pressed, JavaScript will make a request to the server,
         interpret the results and update the current screen. 
         In the purest sense, the user would never know that anything was even transmitted 
         to the server.

AJAX PHP Example
        The following example will demonstrate how a web page can communicate with a web server
             while a user type characters in an input field:
        In the example above, when a user types a character in the input field, 
            a function called "showHint()" is executed.
        The function is triggered by the onkeyup event. -

Explanation:
First, check if the input field is empty (str.length == 0). 
If it is, clear the content of the txtHint placeholder and exit the function.

However, if the input field is not empty, do the following:

Create an XMLHttpRequest object
Create the function to be executed when the server response is ready
Send the request off to a PHP file (search.php) on the server
Notice that q parameter is added to the url (search.php?q="+str)
And the str variable holds the content of the input field
