</head>
<body>
    <h2> PHP Form Handling </h2>
   <pre>
    * We can create and use Forms & Form elements in PHP.
    * The form request may be get or post. 
    * To get form data, we need to use PHP superglobals $_GET and $_POST. 
    * These are superglobals, which means that they are always accessible,
       regardless of scope - and you can access them from any function, class or file without having to do anything special.
    * $_GET is an array of variables passed to the current script via the URL parameters.
    * $_POST is an array of variables passed to the current script via the HTTP POST method.
    * To retrieve data from get request, we need to use $_GET, for post request $_POST.
   
    -> PHP GET Form
        * Get request is the default form request.
        * The data passed through get request is visible on the URL browser
         (possible to bookmark the page), so it is not secured. 
          Used for sending non-sensitive data. 
        * You can send limited amount of data (Limitation is 2000 chars.) through get request.

   -> PHP POST Form
        * Post request is widely used to submit form that have large amount of data 
            such as file upload, image upload, login form, registration form etc.
        * The data passed through post request is not visible on the URL browser 
            so it is secured (Passing data are embedded within the body of the HTTP request). 
        * You can send large amount of data through post request.
        * Supports for multi-part binary input while uploading files to server.
