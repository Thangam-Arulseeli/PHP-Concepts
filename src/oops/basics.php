        <h2>  OOPS CONCEPT  </h2>
        <pre>
            ***** OOP Concepts
                * Programming model organized around Object rather than the actions.
                * Giving importance to data rather than logic.
            
                *** Class in PHP
                 * Blue print for the object
                 * Entity that determines what the object contains and how an object will behave  
                 * Contains set of instruction to build a specific type of object

                *** Object in PHP
                  * Class defines an individual instance of the data structure.
                  * We define a class once and then make many objects that belong to it.
                  * Objects are also known as an instance.

                ** NOTE:
                    * Displays the contents of the class/(type,size and value) about one or more variables,
                      use var_dump(). 
                      Syntax:
                        var_dump($obj);  

                *** Encapsulation
                	* Wrapping up data member and method together into a single unit in the form of object is called Encapsulation.
	                * Keeps the data and the code safe from external interference.
                    * Binding the data with the code that manipulates it.
                    * Encapsulation also allows a class to change its internal implementation 
                      without hurting the overall functioning of the system.
	
                *** const keyword (Class constant)
	                * Defines for any class with keyword const and without $ symbol
	                * Value of these variables cannot be changed any how after assigning.
                    ** Accessing class constants 
                        * Use 'self' keyword to access the class constant within the class
                        * Use :: (Scope Resolution Operator) to access outside the class

                *** static variable - class variable 
                    * Common sharabe variable for the class
                    * Single copy of the variable is maintained in the class
                    * It will not be comming to the object and is accessible by all the objects based on the class
                    * It is accessed by self::variablename like self::$personCount++; 
                    * It is accessed by class name as Person3::$personCount

        *** Important Functions of class and object
            ** get_class($object_name)  -  Gives the class name of an object.
            ** get_class_vars("class_name") - Gets all variables of a class as Array elements.
            ** get_class_methods("class_name") - Gets all methods of a class as an array.
            ** get_declare_classes( ) - Gets all the declared classes in current script along with predefined classes.
            ** get_object_vars($object_name) -Gets all variables of an object as an array.
            ** class_exists("class_name") - Checks whether the specified class is existed or not.
                  If exists return 1 else 0
            ** is_subclass_of("child_class", "parent_class") - Checks whether the 1st class is subclass of 2nd class or not.
                  If so return 1 else 0
            ** method_exists("class_name","function_name") -  By using this function we can check whether the class method is existed or not.
                  If so return 1 else 0
       
        ***** CONSTRUCTOR -- Has been introduced in PHP 5
	        * Constructor is suitable for any initialization that the object may need before it is used.
            * Only one constructor is specified in the class, and is not overloaded
            * Construction Creation
                ** Using  __construct( ) 
	        * Parent constructors are not called implicitly if the child class defines a constructor. 
            * Calls Parent class constructor
                ** parent::__construct() 
        
        ***** DESTRUCTOR  (PHP 5 introduces)
           	* We create destructor by using "__destruct" function.
            * Only one destructor is specified in the class
            * The destructor method will be called as soon as all references to a particular object are removed ( or )
              when the object is explicitly destroyed in any order in shutdown sequence.
            * Destructors (__destruct ( void): void) are methods which are called 
                when there is no reference to any object of the class or goes out of scope or
                 about to release explicitly. 
            * They donâ€™t have any types or return value. 
                It is just called before de-allocating memory for an object or 
                during the finish of execution of PHP scripts or as soon as the execution 
                control leaves the block. 
           
            ** Note: The destructor method is called when the PHP code is executed completely 
                by its last line by using PHP exit() or die() functions.

        ***** TYPE HINTING
            * Type Hinting is method by which we can force function to accept the desired data type.
            * In PHP, we can use type hinting for Object, Array and callable data type.


        ***** Overloading in PHP
	        * Provides means to dynamically create properties and methods.
	        * These dynamic entities are processed via magic methods, 
               one can establish in a class for various action types.
	        * All overloading methods must be defined as Public.
	        * After creating object for a class, we can access set of entities that are properties or methods not defined within the scope of the class.
	        * Such entities are said to be overloaded properties or methods, and the process is called as overloading.
	        * For working with these overloaded properties or functions, PHP magic methods are used.
	        * Most of the magic methods will be triggered in object context 
              except __callStatic() method which is used in static context.
 
            ** Property overloading
	            * PHP property overloading allows us to create dynamic properties in object context.
	            * For creating those properties no separate line of code is needed.
	            * A property which is associated with class instance, and not declared within the scope of the class, is considered as overloaded property.

            ** Some of the magic methods which is useful for property overloading.
	            * __set(): It is triggered while initializing overloaded properties.
	            * __get(): It is utilized for reading data from inaccessible Properties.
	            * __isset(): This magic method is invoked when we check overloaded properties with isset() function.
	            * __unset(): This function will be invoked on using PHP unset() for overloaded properties.
