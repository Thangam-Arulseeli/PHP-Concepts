    *** CRUD - Create-Read-Update-Delete operations performed in DB
    * Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) enables communication between the client (browser) and the server.
      An HTTP request is sent by a client to the server which then returns a response. 
      Though HTTP supports several methods, we will focus on GET, POST, and PUT. 
      Data is processed based on the selected method.

    * The GET method fetches data from the server. 
    
    * The POST method sends data from the HTML form to the server to create a resource. 
    
    * PUT method sends data to the server to create or update a resource. 
      Some developers are unable to differentiate between the POST and PUT methods.

    * The PUT method is idempotent.
      This means calling a PUT method multiple times will not affect the database because data is already updated.
      In contrast, calling a POST method affects the database because you create multiple objects.

    * Forms are defined by the <form><\form> tags. The form tag surrounds all the inputs.
      It also gives instructions about how and where to submit the form.
      The HTML form sends data to your PHP script using either POST or GET methods.
    
    * The action identifies the page where the form input is submitted. 
      Data can be submitted on the same page as the form or on a different page. 
      The method specifies how data is processed. This can be POST, GET, or PUT. 
      The GET method collects data from the server and sends it in the URL. 
      The data submitted via the POST method is stored in the HTTP request body and cannot be seen on the URL.
    
    *** POST method
        * POST is a superglobal method, which collects form data and submits it to the HTTP server. 
          The data entered is encoded, and the content is hidden. POST method has a global scope, and data is accessed from any script.
    
        * The POST method is preferred because data sent through it is not visible in the URL. 
          The POST method is also important because data cannot be decoded by looking into web server logs.
    
        * POST does not have a limitation on the amount of data sent from the form. 
          This is because data is submitted via the body of the HTTP request. The POST method is appropriate for a login form.
    
    *** GET method
        * GET is the default super global method that collects or retrieves data from the server. It has a global scope.
          Thus, data is accessed from any script in the program. The GET method submits data in the URL.
    
        * Data transferred via this method is visible on the URL of the HTTP request. 
          The HTTP request can be cached and saved in the browser history. 
          The disadvantage of the GET method is that it should not be used with sensitive data such as passwords because it is not secure.
    
        * The GET method has a limitation of the amount of data sent from the form. 
          The data being sent on the URL depends on the web server’s operating system and the type of browser.
    
        * Most systems have a limit of 255 characters. 
          The best example of using the GET method is with the search engine forms. 

    *** POST Method                      ->	        GET Method
        * Bookmarking the results is not possible.	->  Results can be bookmarked.
        * Data do not remain in the browser history. It’s hidden. -> 	Data remain in browser history.
        * The performance is low because POST cannot decode the data. ->	The performance is high because of the simple nature of displaying data.
        * It is more secure	      ->      It is less secure
        * Do not limit the amount of data sent to the server. ->	Limit the amount of data sent to the server.
        * It works with sensitive data. ->	It cannot work with sensitive data.
    
    
    *** Update
        * HTML forms are used to update existing data in the database. 
          In this case, we will implement the update functionality. 
          The update form is displayed when we click the edit button in the table cell.
    
        * Take note of the code used to create the edit button on the table. 
          The update button is a submit button for a form with hidden input fields.
    
        * Once the edit button is clicked, the id of the item to be edited is sent to the script update.php. 
          Either the GET or POST method can be used.
    
        <td>
            <form action='update.php' method='post'>
                <input name='id' value='",$row["id"],"' hidden>
                <button type='submit' name='update' value='update'>Edit</button>
            </form>
        </td>
    
        * In the update.php script, a form with data matching the submitted information is displayed for editing. 
          Once the edit is complete, the updated data is resubmitted to the script for processing. 
          In this case, we are using the same script to process update requests.

        * Delete
        * To delete a record in the table, the user clicks the delete button in the HTML table.
        * Take note of the code used to display a button inside a table cell.
        
        <td>
            <form action='form-post.php' method='post'>
                <input name='id' value='",$row["id"],"' hidden>
                <button type='submit' name='delete' value='delete'>Delete</button>
            </form>
        </td>
        
        * The submit button has a hidden id field. The data is sent to a form and processed by the PHP script below. 
          If the id is not empty, then the record with the submitted id is deleted.
